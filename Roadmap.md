## 3. CI/CD Pipelines

### What & Why
- **Continuous Integration** (CI) ensures that your code is automatically built and tested when changes are made.  
- **Continuous Delivery/Deployment** (CD) automates deployment to staging or production after successful tests.

### Learning Path

3. **GitLab CI/CD**  
   - [GitLab CI/CD Docs](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/)  
   - Another popular platform for pipelines, especially if you use GitLab.
4. **FreeCodeCamp or TutorialsPoint**  
   - Offer beginner-friendly tutorials on setting up pipelines step-by-step.

### Practice Tips
- Start by setting up a basic CI pipeline that runs your tests on every commit.  
- Integrate a CD pipeline to automatically deploy a containerized application to a test server.

## 4. WebSockets & WebRTC

### What & Why
- **WebSockets** enable real-time, two-way communication between client and server. Great for chat apps, live dashboards, etc.  
- **WebRTC** focuses on real-time communication (audio/video) and data transfer between peers directly in the browser.

### Learning Path
1. **MDN Web Docs**  
   - [WebSockets on MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebSockets_API)  
   - [WebRTC on MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebRTC_API)  
   - Explains fundamental APIs with simple examples.
2. **Official WebRTC Samples**  
   - [WebRTC GitHub Samples](https://github.com/webrtc/samples)  
   - Detailed code examples showcasing various use cases.
3. **Books & Courses**  
   - **“Real-Time Web Apps with WebSockets”** (O’Reilly short guides can help).  
   - Look for short online courses on real-time communication with WebSockets/WebRTC.

### Practice Tips
- Build a simple chat application using **Socket.io** (for WebSockets) in Node.js.  
- Experiment with WebRTC by creating a basic one-on-one video chat using the official sample codes.

## 5. Unit Testing with Jest

### What & Why
- **Jest** is a popular testing framework mainly used in the JavaScript/TypeScript ecosystem, especially with React.  
- Focuses on simplicity, coverage, and snapshot testing.

### Learning Path
1. **Jest Official Documentation**  
   - [Jest Docs](https://jestjs.io/docs/getting-started)  
   - Clear, short guides to writing your first tests.
2. **Beginner Tutorials**  
   - YouTube channels like **Traversy Media** or **Dev Ed** for concise “Jest and Testing” tutorials.
3. **Practice with a Real Project**  
   - Start with a small Node.js application or React components.

### Practice Tips
- Write tests for utilities and small functions first to understand basic assertions.  
- Move on to snapshot tests for React components if you’re into front-end development.

## 6. AWS Constructs (EC2, S3, Amplify)

### What & Why
- **EC2**: Elastic Compute Cloud for running virtual machines.  
- **S3**: Simple Storage Service for storing and retrieving data.  
- **Amplify**: A development platform for building full-stack web and mobile apps on AWS with minimal DevOps overhead.

## Putting It All Together

1. **Build a Full-Stack Application**  
   - **Front-end**: React or Angular.  
   - **Back-end**: Node.js/Express with a database (MongoDB or PostgreSQL).  
   - **Containers**: Package it with Docker.  
   - **Orchestration**: Use Kubernetes to manage multiple services.  
   - **CI/CD**: Implement a pipeline (GitHub Actions / Jenkins) that automatically builds, tests, and deploys the containers.  
   - **Real-Time Feature**: Add a chat component (WebSockets) or a video call feature (WebRTC).  
   - **Testing**: Write unit tests for front-end and back-end using Jest.  
   - **Deployment**: Deploy to AWS using EC2, S3, or Amplify.

2. **Documentation & Learning Routine**  
   - **Follow Official Docs** consistently as you build.  
   - **Take Notes**: Summarize each concept in your own words for quick revision later.  
   - **Hands-On Practice**: Replicate and modify sample projects, then build your own idea from scratch.

3. **Community & Support**  
   - Join Discord/Slack communities for Docker, Kubernetes, AWS, etc.  
   - Ask questions on Stack Overflow.  
   - Contribute to GitHub projects if you can, or at least explore real-world code.

### Final Advice
- **Start small** but **integrate** each technology in a single end-to-end project when possible.  
- **Focus on fundamentals**: Understand the “why” behind each tool before going deep. This will solidify your knowledge and make interviews easier.  
- **Speed vs. Depth**: Move swiftly through basics, but allocate time to truly practice—hands-on repetition cements concepts faster than just reading.

With these resources and a structured approach, you’ll be well-prepared for college placements as a future full-stack developer! Good luck, and happy learning.
